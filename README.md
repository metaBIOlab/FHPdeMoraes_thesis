# Cortical folding alterations in humans due to aging and diseases
Description of the procedures and analysis present at the Doctorate Thesis from Fernanda Hansen Pacheco de Moraes presented to the Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência Médicas at the [Instituto D’Or de Pesquisa e Ensino](https://idor.org/) as a partial requirement to obtain the Doctorate Degree.

Part of the data used here cannot be shared due to restrictions of the Ethic Comittee. Data can be shared upon reasonable request to the corresponding author. To fullfil these limitation, we will generate random data to simulate the results. Public data used here are from Supporting dataset underlying ["Human cortical folding across regions within individual brains follows universal scaling law"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0421-7/) from Wang et al., and processed data from [AHEAD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920306868) and [AOMIC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00870-6) [PIOP1 and PIOP2](https://nilab-uva.github.io/AOMIC.github.io/).

Get in touch with us via email (fernandahmoraes@gmail.com) or Discussion/Issues in this repository in case any help is needed, our aim is to improve the code as needed and as it goes!
